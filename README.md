### Hangman
Graphic based OOP Hangman

### This is our version of hangman, unlike other versions of hangman instead of adding limbs until you lose, the water rises until you lose. There are also different difficulties available, and there is a shark.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
Graphic based OOP Tic-Tac-Toe

### This is our version of tic-tac-toe, ours is different from others because we wanted ours to be more challenging and require more strategy so it is 4x4 instead of the typical 3x3.
